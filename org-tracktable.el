;;; Commentary:

;; The package provides these three interactive functions:

;; - org-tt-insert-table: inserts a table to keep track of word count
;;   in an org-mode buffer.
;; - org-tt-write: adds an entry with the current word count to the
;;   table. You only need to do this when you're done writing for the
;;   day. If an entry for the current day already exists, this entry
;;   will be updated.
;; - org-tt-status: messages the total word count in the buffer, or
;;   region if active. If the table inserted by org-tt-insert-table
;;   exists, the count of words written the current day is shown
;;   together with percentage of your daily writing goal.

;; These three variables can be customized:

;; - org-tt-day-delay: hours after midnight for new day to start.
;; - org-tt-daily-goal: The number of words you pan to write each day.
;; - org-tt-table-name: The name given to the table inserted by
;;   org-tt-insert-table.


;; For additional info on use and customization, see the README in the
;; github repo.

;; Implementation is based on:
;; - Simon Guest's org-wc.el:
;;   https://github.com/dato/org-wc/blob/master/org-wc.el
;; - Lit Wakefield's chronicler.el:
;;   https://github.com/noctuid/chronicler
